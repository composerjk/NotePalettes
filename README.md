# Note Palettes for Glyphs

These are plugins for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert. With them, you can comfortably edit the *font note* of the current font, and the *glyph note* of the current glyph.

The **font note** is now accessible through *File > Font Info > Notes*, which makes the Font Note plugin obsolete. I therefore do not recommend installing the Font Note plugin anymore.

The **glyph note** is otherwise only visible in the Font tab, switched to List mode, and if the *Note* column is set to show (right-click on the column headers).

### Installation

1. Install the Glyph Note plugin via *Window > Plugin Manager*
2. Restart Glyphs.

If you cannot use the Plugin Manager, follow these steps:

1. Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
2. Double click the .glyphsPalette files. Confirm the dialogs that appear in Glyphs.
3. Restart Glyphs.

### Usage

1. To use the palettes, make sure the Palette sidebar shows: *Window > Palette* (Cmd-Opt-P).
2. You can always edit the font note in the *Font Note* palette.
3. To edit a glyph note, select one or more glyphs, and type in the *Glyph Note* palette.
4. You can resize either note palette by dragging the bottom double line up or down.

### Requirements

Recent versions of Glyphs and macOS. I can only test and guarantee its functionality in the latest OS and app versions. If the plugin does not work for you, you may have to update your app or your system.
